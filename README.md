The Forge Essentials project consists of a permissions and protection system to be used with forge servers, incorporating a certain extent of WorldEdit functionality. Development by the team has officially stopped, though PRs are welcome, be it to fix bugs, or add modules, or whatever.

*More information can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentialsMain/wiki).*

####This repo is for a port to Minecraft 1.6.4. There are compiled builds [here](http://dries007.net:8080/job/FE_164/). Please make backups before attempting to use this on a live server.####
