ForgeEssentialsMain
===================

The code on this branch is for Minecraft 1.6.4. File issues at the issue tracker.

*******************
####Join us on our IRC channel [#forgeessentials](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=forgeessentials&prompt=1) on EsperNet.####

####This repo is for a port to Minecraft 1.6.4. There are compiled builds available on luacs blog (link on the curseforge site). Please do not attempt to use this on a live server, as it is extremely buggy and cases of world corruption have been reported. The 1.5.2 port is safer, use that.####

The Forge Essentials project consists of a permissions and protection system to be used with forge servers, incorporating a certain extent of WorldEdit functionality. Development by the team has officially stopped, though PRs are welcome. (be it to fix bugs, or add modules, or whatever)

*More information can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentialsMain/wiki).*
